# Ford GoBike Trip Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This project performs an exploratory and explanatory data visualization analysis on the Ford GoBike trip dataset. The goal is to understand patterns, trends, and relationships within the data and present key findings through visualizations.

## Data

The dataset used in this project is the "201902-fordgobike-tripdata.csv" file, containing information about individual bike trips, including duration, start and end times and stations, user type, gender, and birth year.

## Analysis

The analysis involved the following steps:

1.  **Data Loading**: Loading the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
2.  **Univariate Exploration**: Examining the distribution of individual variables using histograms and bar charts.
3.  **Bivariate Exploration**: Exploring relationships between pairs of variables using scatter plots and box plots.
4.  **Multivariate Exploration**: Analyzing relationships among multiple variables using heatmaps.
5.  **Summarizing Key Findings**: Identifying the most important patterns, trends, and relationships from the visualizations.
6.  **Refining Visualizations**: Enhancing selected visualizations for clarity and explanatory power.
7.  **Structuring the Presentation**: Outlining the key sections of a presentation to communicate the findings.
8.  **Creating Presentation Content**: Generating explanatory text to accompany the visualizations in the presentation.

## Key Findings

*   The majority of bike trips are short in duration, as indicated by the heavily skewed distribution of `duration_sec`.
*   Subscribers are the dominant user group, significantly outnumbering Customers.
*   The distribution of member gender is heavily skewed towards males.
*   The "bike share for all trip" program is not widely utilized compared to regular trips.
*   Trip durations vary based on user type and gender: Customers tend to have longer durations than Subscribers, and male users tend to have shorter durations than female and other users.
*   Certain stations are significantly more popular than others for both starting and ending trips.

## Next Steps

*   Investigate temporal patterns (e.g., hourly, daily, weekly) to understand peak usage times and potential factors influencing them.
*   Conduct geographical analysis of station usage to identify areas with high demand and potential opportunities for expansion or redistribution of bikes.

## How to Run the Notebook

1.  Upload the "201902-fordgobike-tripdata.csv" file to your Colab environment.
2.  Run the code cells in the notebook sequentially.
3.  The visualizations and printed outputs will show the results of the analysis.
